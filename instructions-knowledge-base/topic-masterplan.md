# Food Calorie Estimation Telegram Bot - Masterplan

## Functionality

1.  **Image Upload:**
    - Users send a food image to the Telegram bot.
2.  **Image Analysis (Multimodal LLM):**
    - The bot forwards the image to a multimodal LLM (Google Gemini Pro Vision or OpenAI GPT-4 with Vision).
    - The LLM generates a detailed text description of the food items in the image, including:
      - Food names
      - Visible characteristics (color, texture, shape)
      - Possible ingredients or preparation methods
      - Relative portion size estimations.
3.  **Food Classification (Reasoning LLM):**
    - We will send above LLM's text description to a reasoning LLM (Google Gemini Pro or OpenAI GPT-4).
    - The reasoning LLM refines the food classification, resolving ambiguities and providing precise food names and standard units of measurement.
4.  **Portion and Nutrition (Reasoning LLM):**
    - We will send above the refined food list and the original image to a reasoning LLM (Google Gemini Pro or OpenAI GPT-4).
    - The reasoning LLM estimates absolute portion sizes, retrieves nutritional data from a database, and calculates the total estimated calorie count.
5.  **Validation and Summary (Reasoning LLM):**
    - We will send above estimated portion sizes and nutritional data to a reasoning LLM (Google Gemini Pro or OpenAI GPT-4).
    - The reasoning LLM validates the data, identifies inconsistencies, and generates a user-friendly summary of the calorie and macronutrient information.
6.  **Telegram Response:**
    - We will send above calorie estimate and nutritional summary back to the user via Telegram.
    - The bot should provide a clear disclaimer about the limitations of calorie estimation from images.

## LLM Strategy

- You can view complete llm strategy in our topic-llm-strategy.md file in our knowledge base.

## Technical Considerations

- **Telegram Bot API:** Integration with the Telegram Bot API for image upload and message delivery.
- **Image Processing:** Efficient handling and storage of uploaded images.
- **Nutritional Database:** Integration with a reliable nutritional database (e.g., USDA FoodData Central).
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for image analysis, LLM calls, and database lookups.
- **User Experience:** Clear and concise communication with users.
- **Privacy:** Secure handling of user data and images.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Profiles:** Storing user dietary preferences and history.
- **Food Logging:** Allowing users to track their daily calorie intake.
- **Recipe Analysis:** Expanding the bot's capabilities to analyze recipes.
- **Voice Input:** Allowing users to describe food items using voice messages.
- **Database Improvement:** Implement a method to allow users to add or edit nutritional data for foods that are missing or incorrect.
